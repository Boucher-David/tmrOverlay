# Data Contract Snapshots

This folder stores compact release snapshots for durable user-data contracts.

Each released app-data contract gets one version directory, for example
`v0.19.0/`. A snapshot directory should contain:

- `data-contract.json`: the release's version constants, durable file classes, sample paths, and compatibility policy.
- `settings/settings.json`: representative user settings that must load through the current `AppSettingsMigrator`.
- `history/samples/`: representative compact history documents. Tests materialize these into app-style car/track/session paths before running current history maintenance.
- `track-maps/samples/`: representative generated map documents. Tests materialize these into the app-generated map filename before running current track-map readers.
- `captures/`: tiny raw-capture metadata/schema samples for diagnostic format compatibility. Do not include raw `telemetry.bin` payloads.
- `runtime-state.json`: a minimal diagnostic runtime-state sample, treated as readable but disposable.

Branch-complete validation should exercise the previous released snapshot against
the current code, including snapshot-to-browser, snapshot-to-localhost, and
snapshot-to-native mapping tests. Future durable schema changes should add the
new version snapshot in the same branch as the migration or compatibility
adapter.

Do not store private driver/team identity, raw capture payloads, source `.ibt`
files, full session YAML, diagnostics bundles, or machine-specific paths here.
