# Version History

TmrOverlay uses SemVer-style annotated Git tags for product milestones:

- Tags use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `v0.6.0`.
- `0.x` versions are pre-release product milestones, so breaking local data or settings changes are still possible when they are documented and migrated.
- Patch versions are reserved for hardening, diagnostics, and compatibility work inside the same product shape.
- The checked-in build version should move with the branch that introduces the next milestone.

## Active Context Pointer

Use `docs/model-v2-future-branches.md` for session-handoff notes, current model-v2 app theory, and future-product signals. Keep this file focused on version history and milestone/release planning.

## Current Branch Target

### v0.19.0 - V1 Candidate Overlay Parity And Readiness

Planned branch name:

```text
fix/live-overlay-capture-regressions
```

Planned scope:

- Promote normalized live reference facts so Standings, Relative, Gap To Leader, Track Map, diagnostics, and browser review validation agree on focus/player/reference identity before overlay-specific interpretation.
- Keep Radar as the explicit local in-car spatial special case while allowing Relative, Standings, Gap To Leader, and Track Map to work from timing/scoring evidence in pits, spectated focus, and replayed browser review contexts.
- Bring Standings, Relative, and Gap To Leader native/localhost behavior into production-contract parity: settings-backed chrome/content, stable row/window sizing, grounded source selection, and no fabricated localhost-only fields.
- Keep Standings grounded in scoring/results order, keep race row membership stable from field/class settings, preserve leader rows when row caps are smaller than class size, and calculate gap/interval only from explicit timing evidence.
- Keep Relative centered and stable around the reference car, use numerical position and delta semantics, preserve blank slots instead of resizing, and avoid radar-only locality rules.
- Port Gap To Leader V2 parity features from legacy/mac where agreed: filtered focused range, threat highlighting, trend metrics, endpoint labels, weather/leader/driver markers, and the 4h growing focus window, while intentionally leaving tactical relative mode out of GtL.
- Align Pit Service native/localhost V2 behavior around the accepted grouped layout, compact session time/lap context, segmented service rows, tire analysis chips, and evidence-backed omission of estimated fuel and in-car setup rows.
- Align Fuel Calculator native/localhost V2 behavior around local player context gating, grouped race/stint metric sections, shared chrome controls, and replay production-model parity while leaving deeper fuel strategy changes for Fuel Calculator v2.
- Align Input State native/localhost behavior around the shared render model, 50 ms refresh, smoothed graph/bar progression, settings-driven graph/right-rail visibility, and in-car-only availability.
- Align Radar native/localhost behavior around the shared render model, distance-based proximity display, class-colour outlines, faster-class approach warning, fade behavior, and bundled/user car-length calibration.
- Align Track Map native/localhost behavior around live-model replay data, fallback map rendering, class-coloured position markers, sector/lap highlight clearing, track-surface incident pulses, and telemetry-built map capture.
- Align Stream Chat native/localhost behavior around fixed-height row flow, shared chrome/content settings, Twitch/live-review message display parity, retained chat history, and documented v1.X stream-v2 follow-up scope for rich event payloads.
- Align Garage Cover localhost behavior around stock privacy-cover imagery, garage-signal activation, localhost image routes, and textless browser review validation.
- Align Session / Weather native/localhost behavior around grouped session/weather rows, settings-driven content cells, metric/imperial units, weather colouring, local wind-facing direction, shared header chrome, and no source footer option for that overlay.
- Fix settings visibility/persistence and overlay chrome persistence for visibility, position, opacity, scale, content/header/footer options, content/header/footer session gates, and localhost settings.
- Add raw `ClutchRaw` capture and input-display fallback while preserving brake behavior for pit/engine-off captures and addressing input wheel clipping.
- Extend browser review replay validation to stream real telemetry-derived overlay models instead of hand-authored demos, with Road Atlanta, four-hour, and 24-hour mid-race rejoin captures as the preferred scenario set.
- Keep uploaded raw captures, screenshots, and diagnostic bundles local unless they are deliberately promoted into compact redacted fixtures or review artifacts.

Technical implementation checklist:

1. Bump shared product/version metadata to `0.19.0` across Windows and the tracked mac harness.
2. Add `LiveReferenceModel` and route shared overlay consumers through it.
3. Update Standings, Relative, Gap To Leader, Track Map, diagnostics, and browser replay tooling to consume normalized reference facts.
4. Keep overlay-specific contexts local to overlays that need them, especially Radar local/in-car spatial gating.
5. Align native and localhost contracts for Standings, Relative, and Gap To Leader, including settings-backed content/header/footer behavior.
6. Align Pit Service native and localhost contracts around grouped sections, segmented service rows, tire analysis chips, and the first-pass feature boundary for fuel estimates and in-car setup rows.
7. Align Fuel Calculator native/localhost contracts around shared local strategy gating, grouped race/stint metric sections, shared source-footer controls, and production-shaped browser review replay models.
8. Align Input State, Radar, Track Map, Stream Chat, Garage Cover, and Session / Weather native/localhost contracts around shared render/view models and settings-backed browser review replay.
9. Add clutch raw capture/read models and use `ClutchRaw` as an input fallback when normalized clutch remains flat zero.
10. Update Settings z-order, persistence, and diagnostics behavior so update/restart and focus transitions preserve visible overlays and settings choices.
11. Extend browser review replay validation to fetch real telemetry-derived overlay models, assert live-model invariants, and preserve generated review artifacts.
12. Validate local static checks, browser tests, screenshot expectations, and git hygiene; use Windows CI or a Windows machine for the full .NET build/test and real WinForms behavior pass.

```text
[v0.19.0] Prepare V1 candidate overlay parity
```

Likely squash body:

```text
- Bumped shared product/version metadata to 0.19.0 and treated this branch as the V1 candidate overlay-readiness pass.
- Standardized the product vocabulary: native is the Windows app/overlay windows, localhost is the OBS route surface, and browser is the local review UI.
- Promoted shared live reference/session facts so Standings, Relative, Gap To Leader, Track Map, diagnostics, and browser review replay start from the same focus/player/reference context.
- Aligned the production overlay suite across native and localhost: Standings, Relative, Gap To Leader, Pit Service, Fuel Calculator, Input State, Radar, Track Map, Stream Chat, Garage Cover, Session / Weather, and Flags now use shared render/view models, settings-backed content/header/footer controls, and production-shaped localhost models where applicable.
- Finished the V2 settings surface pass: simplified overlay controls, removed redundant session filters, rolled Test into Practice, normalized scale/opacity defaults, hid non-functional/development-only controls, moved capture/diagnostic behaviors into Support, and kept settings changes wired to the same contracts native and localhost consume.
- Hardened overlay availability and persistence around local-player gating, race-data freshness, settings preview, Alt+Tab/topmost behavior, update/restart persistence, and all-content-disabled states.
- Added or completed targeted model improvements needed for parity: raw `ClutchRaw` input fallback, shared fuel strategy wrapper, radar body-length calibration and bundled car specs, track-map sector/incident rendering, stream-chat row retention/wrapping, Garage Cover stock-image fallback, session/weather metric cells, and flags diagnostics.
- Extended browser review and replay tooling so validation uses telemetry-derived production-shaped overlay models instead of hand-authored demo rows, including dense 4h race-start replay coverage across the localhost overlay catalog.
- Regenerated product/teammate screenshots and refreshed docs, repo notes, validation guidance, and future-branch notes for the V1 candidate behavior and native/localhost parity target.
- Validated local release hygiene: git diff checks, merge-marker scan, C# compile-shape scan, browser unit tests, browser Playwright tests, browser review replay script checks, Python compile checks, deterministic screenshot validation, Windows screenshot expectation validation, Swift build/test with the Xcode toolchain, and dense 4h race-start browser review replay across the overlay catalog.
- Windows .NET restore/build/test, real WinForms behavior, installer/update, iRacing SDK, and OBS-localhost validation remain the required Windows/CI gates before tagging or calling V1 ready.
```

## Next Planned Milestone

### v0.19.1 - V1 Candidate Polish

Likely scope:

- Use the telemetry and SDK corpora for overlay behavior validation as teammate test evidence arrives.
- Continue release-readiness checks: product-scope lock, installer/update polish, first-run docs, Windows-native behavior validation, and support-bundle completeness.
- Keep branch theory, fixture-corpus decisions, and future-product discussion in `docs/model-v2-future-branches.md`.
