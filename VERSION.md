# Version History

TmrOverlay uses SemVer-style annotated Git tags for product milestones:

- Tags use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `v0.6.0`.
- `0.x` versions are pre-release product milestones, so breaking local data or settings changes are still possible when they are documented and migrated.
- Patch versions are reserved for hardening, diagnostics, and compatibility work inside the same product shape.
- The checked-in build version should move with the branch that introduces the next milestone.

## Current Branch Target

### v0.7.0 - Simple Model-V2 Overlays And Design-V2 Preview

Suggested squash title:

```text
[v0.7.0] Add simple model-v2 overlays and design-v2 preview states
```

Suggested squash body:

```text
- Add production relative, flags, session/weather, pit-service, input/car-state, and local radar v2 overlay paths.
- Add shared simple telemetry overlay shell/view-model helpers for dense direct-telemetry windows.
- Expand live model-v2 spatial, timing, sector, delta, and diagnostics evidence for simple overlays and later analysis products.
- Add design-v2 mock states for relative, standings, flags, sector comparison, blindspot, laptime delta, and stint laptime log.
- Document future product branches including IBT-derived track-map generation, pit crew/engineer workflows, overlay bridge, streaming overlays, overlay builder, and publishing.
- Refresh screenshot validation artifacts and tests for the new overlay surface.
```

Status: not tagged yet. Tag `v0.7.0` only after this branch is merged or otherwise declared as the release point.

### v0.2.1 - Post-Capture Collection Hardening

Commit: `838154b`

Squash title:

```text
[v0.2.1] Harden capture status, history export, and build freshness checks
```

Summary:

- Improved failed/waiting/live telemetry messaging in the status overlay.
- Added runtime build-freshness checks so local builds warn when source files are newer than the executable.
- Hardened raw capture session state, manifest metadata, status snapshots, and replay behavior.
- Added history export and YAML forensics tools for analyzing collected captures.
- Added baseline synthetic endurance history fixtures for future overlay work.
