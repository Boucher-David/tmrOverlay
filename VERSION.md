# Version History

TmrOverlay uses SemVer-style annotated Git tags for product milestones:

- Tags use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `v0.6.0`.
- `0.x` versions are pre-release product milestones, so breaking local data or settings changes are still possible when they are documented and migrated.
- Patch versions are reserved for hardening, diagnostics, and compatibility work inside the same product shape.
- The checked-in build version should move with the branch that introduces the next milestone.

## Current Branch Target

### v0.13.0 - Core Overlay Readiness

Planned branch name:

```text
v0.13-core-overlay-readiness
```

Planned scope:

- Promote core overlays to model-v2 consumers where the data contracts are now stable.
- Treat live row coverage, scoring snapshots, and rendered-car limits as first-class assumptions instead of silently compressing missing competitors.
- Keep local in-car radar scoped to player-in-car proximity and side-warning telemetry.
- Harden flags, session/weather, pit service, inputs, garage cover, fuel, gap, standings, relative, and track map behavior around real telemetry evidence.
- Add diagnostic-first probes for future penalty detail, TC/dual-clutch, forecast, relative-lap pending, and spotter/teammate pit-change questions.
- Add shared overlay availability/freshness and app diagnostics status models.
- Keep remaining V2 candidates, such as driver role/focus, race events/penalties, pit strategy, track asset quality, and post-race summaries, as V1.N follow-up foundations.

Technical implementation checklist:

1. Bump shared .NET product/version metadata to `0.13.0`.
2. Move standings to scoring-snapshot ordering with timing enrichment and class-group/browser settings.
3. Keep Track Map plotted from real spatial progress while using scoring rows only for marker identity/color enrichment.
4. Promote Relative, local in-car Radar, Flags, Session / Weather, Pit Service, Input / Car State, Fuel, and Gap To Leader to stable model-v2 inputs where appropriate.
5. Keep Garage Cover localhost-only, image-backed, previewable, and fail-closed when telemetry is unavailable or stale.
6. Add shared race-progress and overlay-availability/status-diagnostics models with focused unit coverage.
7. Keep uncertain telemetry semantics diagnostic-first and document V1.N model follow-ups.
8. Refresh docs/context/version metadata and run branch validation available from macOS, with Windows build/test/publish left to Windows CI.

Implemented baseline in this branch:

- Bumped shared .NET product/version metadata to `0.13.0`.
- Added shared model-v2 race progress, overlay availability/freshness, and app diagnostics status contracts.
- Promoted core overlays to normalized model-v2 consumers across standings, relative, local radar, flags, session/weather, pit service, inputs, fuel, gap, and track map behavior.
- Reworked Standings around scoring snapshots, class grouping, configurable other-class rows, pit labels, and browser-source settings.
- Kept Track Map from compressing missing competitors by plotting only cars with usable spatial progress while enriching labels/colors from scoring rows.
- Scoped Radar to accurate local player-in-car telemetry, keeping timing-only and non-local focus cases diagnostic/future.
- Reworked Flags into multi-flag procedural display with steady green suppressed and penalty detail kept diagnostic-first.
- Added Garage Cover image import/preview/fail-closed localhost behavior plus diagnostics.
- Split Fuel strategy inputs around shared fuel/pit and race-progress models while preserving history fallback.
- Moved Gap To Leader to race-only model-v2 timing/race-progress inputs with legacy fallback.
- Extended diagnostics and docs for forecast-like channels, spotter/teammate pit changes, TC/dual-clutch evidence, relative lap relationships, and future model branches.
- Added focused unit coverage for new settings, browser-source, diagnostics, race-progress, gap, availability, and model-v2 consumer behavior.

- Promoted core overlays to normalized model-v2 consumers across Standings, Relative, local Radar, Flags, Session / Weather, Pit Service, Input / Car State, Fuel, Gap To Leader, and Track Map.
- Reworked Standings around scoring-snapshot ordering, class grouping, configurable other-class rows, pit labels, and localhost browser-source settings.
- Kept Track Map marker placement honest under partial live coverage by plotting only cars with usable spatial progress and using scoring rows only for identity/color enrichment.
- Scoped Radar to accurate local player-in-car proximity and side-warning telemetry while leaving non-local focus and timing-only placement as future evidence-aware work.
- Reworked Flags into a multi-flag procedural display, suppressed steady green running, and kept exact penalty instruction text diagnostic-first.
- Added Garage Cover image import, preview, localhost fail-closed behavior, and diagnostics.
- Split Fuel strategy inputs around shared fuel/pit and race-progress models while preserving history fallback.
- Moved Gap To Leader to race-only model-v2 timing/race-progress inputs with legacy leader-gap fallback.
- Extended compact diagnostics and docs for forecast-like weather, spotter/teammate pit changes, TC/dual-clutch evidence, relative lap-relationship probes, and future V1.N model foundations.
- Validation: git diff --check, conflict-marker sweep, C# compile-shape scanner, tracked screenshot validation, and Windows screenshot expectation validation. Windows restore/build/test/screenshot/publish validation remains CI-owned from this Mac because `dotnet` is not installed locally.

```

Summary:

- Bumped shared .NET product/version metadata to 0.9.0 and wired a generated Windows executable icon derived from the checked-in TMR logo.
- Hardened the Windows GitHub Actions workflow so PR/main run restore/build/test, tracked screenshot validation, and a self-contained publish dry run with package audit, while tag/manual release packaging publishes a self-contained win-x64 app, zips it, generates manifest/checksum files, and uploads release artifacts.
- Added tag-driven GitHub Release creation for vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH tags with versioned Windows zip/manifest/checksum assets and generated release notes.
- Added Windows tester release docs covering package contents, download, checksum verification, portable install, app-data compatibility, schema-migration expectations, upgrade, rollback, unsigned SmartScreen expectations, and diagnostics handoff.
- Reworked the Support tab into a task-oriented surface for app status, diagnostics bundle actions, diagnostic telemetry capture, storage shortcuts, compact app activity, and discoverable advanced collection status.
- Disabled advanced collection outputs by default for tester builds, including edge-case clips, model-v2 parity, live overlay diagnostics, and post-race analysis, while keeping config/env overrides and tests for enabling them.
- Added repo-surface docs and ignore rules to separate customer/tester-facing material, product source, internal development assets, and generated local runtime data.
- Updated the update strategy to treat portable GitHub Releases as the v0.9 baseline while keeping signing, installer selection, and passive update checks as follow-up work.

```text
[v0.8.0] Polish settings, overlay controls, and mac review parity

- Added per-overlay opacity controls where useful, while keeping Flags and Radar exempt, and kept Gap To Leader race-only in settings/runtime policy.
- Polished Relative, Flags, Input/Car State, and Gap behavior: compact actual relative rows, vertical class marker, screen-border flag display that follows active telemetry flags, graphical pedal traces/wheel input, and live-updating gap context.
- Added TMR brand assets plus Windows tray/settings icon loading from the checked-in source logo.
- Brought the ignored mac harness to v0.8 review parity, including matching settings options, telemetry-driven flag display, overlay defaults, regenerated screenshots, and validation updates.
- Bumped settings migration to prune obsolete flag timer options now that flag display lifetime is driven by telemetry.
- Updated branch-complete hygiene so docs, screenshots, stale-reference sweeps, version text, and release metadata are treated as final branch-readiness artifacts.
