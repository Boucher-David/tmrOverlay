# Overlay Behavior Reference

This is the human-readable review file for how each overlay decides what to show. It is intentionally written for teammates reviewing behavior, not for C# implementation details.

For visual decision paths, see [Overlay Flow Diagrams](overlay-flow-diagrams.md).

## Global Rules

All managed native overlays use the same outer visibility rules:

1. The Settings window opens at startup. Driving/support overlays stay hidden unless the user enables them.
2. An overlay is eligible to show when its setting is enabled and its session filter allows the current session kind.
3. The General-tab Show Preview mode supplies deterministic Practice, Qualifying, or Race telemetry only. It does not enable hidden overlays, bypass session filters, move windows, change opacity, change topmost state, or force Stream Chat open.
4. Race-data overlays fade out when live telemetry is disconnected, not collecting, or stale. Status and Stream Chat are not race-data overlays for this fade policy.
5. Local-only overlays also require their declared live context before their native windows are shown. Radar and Inputs require local player in-car focus; Fuel Calculator and Pit Service require local player focus plus active in-car or pit context.
6. Settings preview controls can show an overlay for configuration review, but that is treated as a settings preview, not a normal runtime visibility decision.
7. Browser-source pages read the same normalized overlay models where practical. The browser review server uses deterministic fixtures and is a development/review surface, not the production iRacing runtime.

## Settings

Purpose: Control the app, overlays, diagnostics, updates, browser-source hints, and support bundle workflow.

Behavior:

- Always opens at startup and is the normal control surface.
- Keeps a fixed application-window size.
- General owns units, session preview, broad app controls, and support/diagnostics.
- Each overlay tab owns enabled state, size/scale, opacity where useful, session filters where useful, content settings, and browser-source sizing hints.
- Overlay options are stored in keyed `OverlaySettings.Options` entries so new header, footer, and column controls can be added without expanding the durable settings model each time.

## Standings

Purpose: Show the live scoring table around the reference car while preserving multiclass context.

Inputs:

- Primary: `LiveTelemetrySnapshot.Models.Scoring`
- Fallback: `LiveTelemetrySnapshot.Models.Timing`
- Driver labels and class colors from the driver directory and scoring rows

Behavior:

- Waits for fresh telemetry, then waits for scoring or timing rows.
- Uses the scoring model when available because it carries grouped multiclass standings.
- Selects the reference car from scoring/timing focus rows or the driver directory focus reference.
- In race-like sessions, hides rows until cars have valid lap evidence so pre-grid noise does not look like race order.
- Keeps class groups in official table order, then chooses the reference class as the primary group.
- Shows as many primary-class rows as possible while reserving bounded rows for other classes when class separators are enabled.
- Highlights the reference row, pit rows, class headers, and partial rows.
- If scoring is missing, falls back to timing rows ordered by class position, overall position, class-leader gap, lap gap, then car index.

Reviewer checks:

- Does the reference class stay visible under row limits?
- Are other classes present without taking over the table?
- Do practice/qualifying/race sessions avoid misleading pre-lap rows?

## Relative

Purpose: Show nearby cars ahead and behind the reference car.

Inputs:

- Primary: `LiveTelemetrySnapshot.Models.Relative.Rows`
- Reference from model-v2 focus rows; no player fallback when focus is unavailable
- Driver directory and scoring rows for labels, numbers, classes, and colors

Behavior:

- Waits for fresh telemetry and relative data.
- Builds a reference row when a focus car index is known.
- Takes a configured number of cars ahead and behind.
- Ahead rows are sorted nearest-first for selection, then displayed farthest-to-nearest above the reference row.
- Behind rows are sorted nearest-first below the reference row.
- Gap text prefers usable relative seconds. Partial rows are marked when neither timing nor placement evidence is fully usable.
- Reference position is suppressed when the current session kind makes official position misleading.

Reviewer checks:

- Are cars ordered naturally around the reference car?
- Are partial/fallback rows visually distinct enough without making normal rows noisy?
- Does the reference row stay stable when scoring is missing?

## Fuel Calculator

Purpose: Estimate fuel range, stops, final stint shape, and whether tire service is effectively free.

Inputs:

- `LiveLocalStrategyContext`
- `FuelStrategySnapshot`
- User and baseline session history for burn-rate context
- Unit system setting

Behavior:

- Requires a local active driver/team context. In native overlay mode, focus on another car, unavailable focus, missing player car, garage/setup context, and no active local/pit context keep the enabled window hidden; browser/model callers show `waiting for local fuel context`.
- Shows planned race laps, stint count, and final stint target when those are known.
- Otherwise shows current fuel, race laps remaining, and additional fuel needed.
- Displays a strategy row when changing fuel rhythm avoids extra stops.
- Displays stint rows for meaningful stints or a no-fuel-stop finish state.
- Source text shows fuel-per-lap source, full-tank range, history source, historical min/avg/max when available, tire model source, and leader/class gap context.
- Tire advice explains pending data, free tires, or expected time/fuel tradeoff.

Reviewer checks:

- Does the overlay distinguish live burn from historical/baseline burn?
- Does the final stint display avoid implying an unnecessary fuel stop?
- Are units correct in Metric and Imperial modes?

## Track Map

Purpose: Draw the track, sector highlights, local car, and nearby/opponent markers.

Inputs:

- Track map documents from bundled assets or user-generated IBT maps
- `LiveTelemetrySnapshot.Models.TrackMap`
- Driver/class context for markers

Behavior:

- Uses the best map for the current track identity when available.
- Falls back to a deterministic placeholder when no map exists.
- Reloads map identity periodically so newly generated maps can appear without restarting.
- Draws racing line, pit lane when available, start/finish, sector boundaries, sector highlight state, and car markers.
- Smooths marker progress so live telemetry jitter does not make cars visually jump.
- Keeps IBT-derived raw source files out of app storage; stored maps contain derived display geometry and quality metadata only.

Reviewer checks:

- Does the fallback avoid pretending to be a real track?
- Do sector highlights match the model state?
- Do markers move smoothly without hiding stale or unavailable telemetry?

## Stream Chat

Purpose: Show stream chat messages without depending on iRacing telemetry.

Inputs:

- Stream Chat provider settings
- Twitch IRC websocket when configured
- Streamlabs/browser widget settings where supported

Behavior:

- Defaults disabled and not configured.
- Does not fade with telemetry availability.
- Is not forced open by diagnostics or session preview.
- Connects only when the provider/channel settings are valid.
- Keeps a bounded message list and visible message budget.
- Shows unavailable/not-configured state instead of stealing focus or opening because telemetry preview is active.

Reviewer checks:

- Hidden Stream Chat must stay hidden during Show Preview and diagnostics.
- A not-configured chat should not look like a broken telemetry overlay.
- The overlay should not take focus from the Settings window or the app UI.

## Garage Cover

Purpose: Provide an OBS/browser-source privacy cover for garage/setup screens.

Inputs:

- Garage/setup visibility from live race-event state
- User-imported cover image when configured
- Browser-source route state

Behavior:

- Browser-source only.
- Fails closed: if telemetry is missing, stale, unavailable, or the garage is visible, it renders the cover/fallback rather than exposing garage content.
- Uses the configured image when available; otherwise renders a deterministic fallback.
- Does not appear as a normal native driving overlay.

Reviewer checks:

- Does missing telemetry cover the screen instead of exposing setup details?
- Does the browser route stay useful even without a user image?

## Flags

Purpose: Show active race-control flags.

Inputs:

- Normalized flag/race-event state from live telemetry
- Flag category settings

Behavior:

- Managed by normal overlay visibility, but internally hides when there are no displayable flags.
- Requires a known session kind before showing through normal runtime logic.
- Uses transparent/click-through native behavior.
- Filters active flags through enabled categories before rendering.
- Suppresses itself while the Settings overlay is active when needed to protect Settings input and z-order.

Reviewer checks:

- Does the overlay stay gone when there are no active flags?
- Do category toggles hide only the intended flag types?
- Does it avoid blocking Settings interaction?

## Session / Weather

Purpose: Show session clock, lap context, track identity, temperatures, surface, sky, wind, humidity, and fog.

Inputs:

- `LiveTelemetrySnapshot.Models.Session`
- Weather, race progress, and race projection models
- Unit system setting

Behavior:

- Waits for fresh telemetry and session data.
- Formats elapsed/remain clocks compactly when appropriate.
- Shows lap totals and remaining lap context only when values are finite and plausible.
- Shows track display name plus track length when known.
- Converts temperatures and wind speed by unit system.
- Highlights changed weather/surface values with info tone.

Reviewer checks:

- Are invalid/unbounded lap counts hidden or clearly represented?
- Are Metric and Imperial conversions correct?
- Does the overlay avoid showing stale weather as live?

## Pit Service

Purpose: Summarize session context, pit release/service state, requested service, and tire-service evidence.

Inputs:

- Normalized pit/fuel service model
- Fuel, tire, repair, pit-road, and pit-stall state
- Unit system setting

Behavior:

- Requires fresh telemetry, local active driver/team context, and pit-service data. In native overlay mode, focus on another car, unavailable focus, missing player car, garage/setup context, and no active local/pit context keep the enabled window hidden; browser/model callers show `waiting for local pit-service context`.
- Still renders during the local pit window: on pit road, in the pit stall, or while service is active.
- Groups rows as `Session`, `Pit Signal`, `Service Request`, and `Tire Analysis` in both native and browser surfaces.
- Production localhost browser-source pages build the Pit Service model from the same normalized live snapshot and `PitServiceOverlayViewModel` path as native Design V2; spoofed all-row Pit Service data is limited to browser-review tooling.
- Shows compact time plus lap context when telemetry exposes plausible values, so lap-based races can display remaining/total laps alongside the clock.
- Shows release and pit-service status in `Pit Signal`; the old pit-location row is intentionally omitted because it duplicated lower-value context.
- Shows service requests as segmented rows: fuel request is requested state plus selected fuel amount, tearoff is requested state, repair is required/optional time, and fast repair is selected state plus remaining availability.
- Shows tire analysis as per-corner chip cells for compound, change/keep, set limits/availability/used state, cold pressure, temperature, wear, and distance when those rows are enabled and available.
- Uses warning/info/success tones for release, repair, and tire availability/change state rather than treating all pit messages equally.
- Formats fuel volume according to the selected unit system.
- Does not show estimated fuel or in-car setup rows in this pass; estimated fuel belongs to the future Fuel Calculator V2 shared strategy model, and ARB/wing rows need deliberate raw-capture proof before promotion.

Reviewer checks:

- Does the overlay distinguish requested service from active/completed service?
- Are repair and tire states understandable under partial telemetry?
- Do the browser-source and native Design V2 Pit Service layouts stay functionally identical?

## Input / Car State

Purpose: Show local car controls and mechanical state.

Inputs:

- `LiveTelemetrySnapshot.Models.Inputs`
- Local car state, engine warnings, gear, RPM, speed, temperatures, pressures, and voltage
- Unit system setting

Behavior:

- Waits for fresh telemetry, then requires the focused local player in-car context and local car telemetry.
- Shows speed, gear/RPM, pedals, steering, warnings, electrical state, cooling, and oil/fuel pressure.
- Converts speed, temperature, and pressure by unit system.
- Treats engine warnings as warning-tone rows.
- Suppresses shared header/footer controls because this overlay is graph/content-focused.

Reviewer checks:

- Are missing values rendered as unavailable rather than zero?
- Do warnings stand out without making normal telemetry noisy?

## Car Radar

Purpose: Show local side pressure and nearby car placement.

Inputs:

- Spatial/radar model
- Local reference car progress
- Nearby car placement and side-signal state

Behavior:

- Waits for fresh telemetry.
- Focuses on local in-car radar. Spectator/teammate focus or missing local context suppresses normal radar display.
- Uses side occupancy signals for immediate left/right pressure when available.
- Uses nearby placement candidates for visual car positions when telemetry is usable.
- Degrades gracefully when only timing evidence is available; diagnostics can record those cases, but the end-user radar should not pretend timing-only data is exact spatial placement.

Reviewer checks:

- Does local-only suppression avoid showing wrong radar for spectator/teammate focus?
- Are left/right pressure states correct when `CarLeftRight` changes?
- Does the overlay avoid overclaiming exact position from partial data?

## Gap To Leader

Purpose: Show gap trend to leader or class leader.

Inputs:

- Timing/leader-gap model
- Race/session kind
- Recent gap samples retained in the overlay form

Behavior:

- Waits for fresh telemetry and usable gap data.
- Tracks bounded recent gap points for a compact trend graph.
- Handles race and non-race gap semantics separately because practice/qualifying gaps can mean different things than race order.
- Avoids treating huge lap-equivalent gaps or discontinuities as ordinary trend movement.
- Uses diagnostics artifacts for future tuning, but the production overlay only displays the current bounded model state.

Reviewer checks:

- Does the graph avoid wild jumps on session resets or pit/context changes?
- Does the status text make race vs non-race gap source clear enough?

## Status

Purpose: Give support/development visibility into app state.

Behavior:

- Not treated as a race-data overlay.
- Shows telemetry/capture/support state rather than driving data.
- Should stay separate from future product surfaces unless deliberately promoted through a product pass.

Reviewer checks:

- Does it help diagnose startup/capture state without becoming an end-user driving overlay?

## Browser Review Surface

Purpose: Fast mac-friendly review for browser-source overlays and broad app layout.

Behavior:

- `npm run review:browser` starts a local fixture-backed server.
- `/review/app` shows the Settings shell plus a full overlay validator stage.
- `/review/settings/general` shows the General tab preview controls.
- `/review/overlays/<overlay-id>` and `/overlays/<overlay-id>` render individual overlay pages from the same assets used by Windows localhost routes.
- Preview query parameters provide deterministic mock telemetry; they do not change production native overlay visibility rules.

Reviewer checks:

- Browser review is the right loop for layout, JavaScript behavior, and localhost parity.
- Windows remains the authority for native focus, topmost, click-through, iRacing SDK capture, installer/update behavior, and WinForms screenshots.
