# History Data Evolution

This note defines how newer app versions should handle user data written by older versions.

## Goals

- Preserve useful user car/track/session history across app upgrades.
- Give highest migration priority to data that strengthens future user-facing overlay behavior, such as car/track combo history, stint shape, pit-service timing, fuel usage, lap pace, and confidence/source metadata.
- Prefer deterministic rebuilds over lossy aggregate mutation.
- Keep live telemetry collection and overlays resilient when legacy data is corrupt, incomplete, or unsupported.
- Make maintenance visible in diagnostics without putting modal upgrade prompts over the sim.

## Priority

Not every persisted file deserves the same upgrade effort.

High-priority data is user-focused history that makes the app better for that user later:

- car/track/session summaries
- fuel burn and stint history
- pit lane, pit stall, tire-service, repair, and fill-rate history
- lap pace and leader/context metrics used by overlays
- confidence flags and source labels that explain whether a metric came from local-driver telemetry, team-car telemetry, inference, or baseline samples

Medium-priority data is user preference and app behavior state:

- overlay visibility, position, scale, units, and display options
- update channel or future bridge settings

Low-priority data is operational telemetry:

- performance snapshots
- debug logs
- runtime heartbeats
- diagnostics bundles

Low-priority data should usually stay readable or disposable, not migrated, unless it becomes an input to a user-facing historical model.

## Data Categories

### Source Data

Session summaries under `history/user/cars/.../summaries/` are the canonical compact history records. They should carry enough schema and collection metadata for future migration:

- `summaryVersion`
- `collectionModelVersion`
- `appVersion`
- `sourceCaptureId`
- combo identity
- quality/confidence flags

When a future collection model changes, migrate these records first when the old fields can be mapped honestly.

### Derived Data

These files should be rebuilt from source data instead of patched in place:

- `aggregate.json`
- post-race analysis JSON generated from a summary

Aggregates are running metrics and lose per-session detail. Rebuilding from migrated summaries avoids compounding old calculation mistakes.

### Immutable Diagnostics

These artifacts should remain readable as diagnostics but should not be migrated into the current history model:

- raw capture folders
- `telemetry.bin`
- raw telemetry schemas
- edge-case reports
- diagnostics bundles
- performance logs

If a tool needs to inspect them later, it should read their own `formatVersion` or schema metadata.

### Runtime Data

Runtime state and caches may be dropped or overwritten when incompatible. They should not affect user history compatibility.

## Versioning Rules

Every durable user-data schema should have an explicit current version constant in code and a matching migration path.

Use these version scopes:

- `summaryVersion`: JSON shape of a stored session summary.
- `collectionModelVersion`: meaning of derived history metrics, quality rules, stint/pit-stop extraction, and confidence flags.
- `aggregateVersion`: JSON shape of aggregate files.
- `analysisVersion`: JSON shape of post-race analysis files.

The app should write only the current versions. Readers may accept older versions only through migration or explicit compatibility adapters.

`fixtures/data-contracts/v0.19.0/` is the first checked-in release snapshot for this policy. Future durable schema branches should add the next versioned snapshot there and keep tests proving the previous release snapshot can load into the current app. See `docs/data-contracts.md` for the full snapshot workflow.

## Validation Sweep

Schema changes are compatibility events. If a durable user-data model changes shape or meaning, the same sweep that checks stale docs and tests must also verify backwards compatibility:

- decide whether to bump `summaryVersion`, `collectionModelVersion`, `aggregateVersion`, or `analysisVersion`
- add or update migrations, rebuild logic, or compatible readers before overlays consume the data
- add tests for old data, unsupported future data, and degraded/corrupt data where the change can affect user history
- update the versioned release snapshot under `fixtures/data-contracts/` and keep the previous release snapshot covered by tests
- update `HistorySchemaCompatibilityTests` so the durable schema snapshot changes only after the compatibility decision is explicit
- update this note, repo context, and any user-facing docs that describe persisted history

## Maintenance Flow

Add a `HistoryMaintenanceService` before relying on history for overlays:

1. Read a maintenance manifest from `history/user/.maintenance/manifest.json`.
2. Inventory summary, aggregate, and analysis files.
3. Detect schema and collection model versions.
4. Run ordered migrations for supported summary versions.
5. Rebuild aggregates from compatible migrated summaries.
6. Rebuild or mark stale generated analysis files when the source summary changed.
7. Write a new manifest with counts, migrated versions, skipped files, failures, and timestamps.
8. Record an app event and include the manifest in diagnostics.

The service should be best-effort. If it fails, overlays should behave as if no compatible history exists.

## Write Safety

Migration writes must be atomic:

- write to a temp file in the same directory
- flush and replace the target file
- keep a timestamped backup for major migrations under `history/user/.backups/{yyyyMMdd-HHmmss}/`

Do not delete legacy source files in the same release that first migrates them.

## Compatibility Policy

Migrate when:

- required old fields are present
- units and meanings are known
- a confidence flag can honestly describe degraded precision
- aggregates can be rebuilt from source summaries

Skip when:

- a required field was never collected
- the old metric had a different meaning that cannot be mapped
- source data is corrupt or partial
- migration would require raw telemetry that is not present

Skipped files should remain on disk and be excluded from current aggregates. The manifest should include a reason such as `unsupported_schema`, `missing_required_field`, or `corrupt_json`.

## Implemented Slice

The current implementation is intentionally narrow:

- new session summaries include `collectionModelVersion`
- `HistoryMaintenanceService` runs in the background at startup when session history is enabled
- legacy summaries missing version metadata are normalized and backed up
- `aggregate.json` is rebuilt from all compatible summaries in each car/track/session folder
- corrupt, unsupported, or future-version summaries are skipped and recorded in the maintenance manifest
- `SessionHistoryQueryService` rejects incompatible aggregate versions instead of feeding them to overlays
- `aggregateVersion = 3` keeps combo aggregates track/session scoped and removes radar calibration from `aggregate.json`
- car radar body-size calibration is stored separately at `history/user/cars/{carKey}/radar-calibration.json`, versioned by `carRadarCalibrationAggregateVersion`
- diagnostics bundles include `history/user/.maintenance/manifest.json` when present
- `HistorySchemaCompatibilityTests` snapshots durable summary, aggregate, and analysis model shapes so schema changes force a compatibility review during test validation

Radar calibration history is car-scoped, not track/session-scoped. Summaries may store clean `CarLeftRight` side-window durations, identity-backed body-length estimates, and confidence flags. The car-level aggregate stops accepting new learned samples once the body-length metric is trusted. Live radar uses exact bundled car specifications first, trusted user calibration second, low-confidence bundled estimates third, and the hard-coded default only when none of those are available.

Settings already use `AppSettingsMigrator`; history maintenance should follow that pattern but operate on directories of files instead of one settings document.

Future summary shape changes should add ordered summary migrations to the maintenance service, then keep aggregate rebuild logic derived from migrated summaries.
